# This is a Machine Learning Internship Task 2 at TechnoHacks Edutech

# Task : Diabetes Prediction

# About the Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

# Steps Performed in the Task :
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning and Data Preprocessing
3. Outliers Detection and Removing of Outliers
4. Data Visualization (using matplotlib , seaborn and plotly)
5. Gathered Insights from analysis
6. Selecting Dependent and Independent Features and Train Test Split
7. Normalization of Data
8. Building of Classification Model and Generating Prediction
9. As a result got **Logistic Regression** as the **best model** with **82 % Accuracy**.


This Project is good for Data Analysis and Predictive modeling Tasks.

I would love **If You give Star for My Performance**
